###Chip8
Chip8 is a programming language originally created for the COSMAC VIP. 
You can view it as an assembly language. It has only 16 registers to work with (so 16 variables max), and only 35 instructions
(methods if you'd like). It is old after all. 
I found the language as part of a game jam introducted to me: [Octojam](https://http://octojam.com/).
You can find more information about the language on the website's link to its git repo. This includes a manual and some tutorials.

###The game
It is a very simple game. You just shoot the enemy while avoiding being shot. The code is not efficient but it works.
